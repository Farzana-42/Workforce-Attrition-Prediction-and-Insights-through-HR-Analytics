# Employee Attrition Prediction System - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

Built an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict employee attrition with 85.5% accuracy using a Random Forest ensemble model trained on 19,104 employee records.

## Business Problem

- Employee turnover costs organizations 30-200% of annual salary per person
- Most companies are reactive (notice after resignation) instead of proactive
- Need: Predictive system to identify at-risk employees early

## Solution

Interactive web application that:
- Accepts employee data in any format
- Predicts attrition risk for each employee
- Identifies key risk factors
- Provides actionable retention insights

## Key Results

- 85.5% prediction accuracy
- 79% recall (catches 4 of 5 actual leavers)
- 0.8886 AUC-ROC (excellent discrimination)
- Identifies 2,405 high-risk employees from 19,104 total
